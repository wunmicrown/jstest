Part One:
1. *What is a `for` loop in JavaScript, and what is its primary purpose?*

2. *How do you declare and initialize a counter variable in a `for` loop?*

3. *Write a `for` loop that counts from 1 to 5 and logs each number to the console.*

4. *What is the syntax for a `for` loop in JavaScript?*

5. *Explain the three parts of a `for` loop: initialization, condition, and increment.*

6. *Write a `for` loop that prints the even numbers from 2 to 10.*

7. *What is an infinite loop, and how can you avoid creating one with a `for` loop?*

8. *What is the difference between a `for` loop and a `while` loop?*

9. *Write a `for` loop that iterates backward from 10 to 1 and logs each number to the console.*

10. *How can you break out of a `for` loop prematurely, before it reaches its normal exit condition?*


Part Two:
1. Write a for loop that counts from 1 to 5 and logs each number to the console.

2. Create a for loop that prints the multiples of 3 from 3 to 15.

3. Write a for loop to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 10 and store the result in a variable called total.

4.  Create a for loop to print the square of numbers from 1 to 5.

5.  Write a for loop that logs the numbers from 10 down to 1.

6. Use a for loop to print "Hello, World!" five times, each on a new line.

7.  Create a for loop that logs the even numbers from 2 to 10.

8. Write a for loop to calculate the product of numbers from 1 to 5 and store the result in a variable called product.

9. Use a for loop to print the numbers from 5 to 15, but skip every even number.

10. Write a for loop that prints the numbers from 0 to 3 in reverse order (3, 2, 1, 0).
